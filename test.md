#Prescriptions Discovery Sprint Retrospective  

##Worked Well  

###Decision process, specifically:  
- Preparing all options in advance 
- Presenting options to Marina as a final step 
- The decision helped clarify a larger strategy question

###Using data to make decisions: 
- Google analytics 
- User research (although need more)

### Logistics 
- 2 weeks was necessary 
- Final PPT deck is a good template for future 
- Meeting interview template  
- Good job with notetaking and documenting meetings

### Team dynamics 
- Having a lead is necessary 
- Including someone from the sprint team is super important 
- High engagement from the team 
- Splitting up meeting facilitation was helpful 
- Daily debriefs


## Needs improvement

###Logistics 
- All team members need to be able to attend Monday kick-off meeting  
- Engage leadership earlier to get buy-in and set expectations (2-3 weeks in advance), reach out to stakeholders earlier with leadership support 
- Identify potential admin support from stakeholder side to help schedule meetings 
- Consider having a slide to present at each meeting? 
- Get access to backend systems in advance  
- Definitely need 2 weeks  
- Should have made an effort to meet in person 
- Devote time to tracking documents better 
- Track meeting/scheduling status better  

### Team dynamics 
- Remote participation was hard â€“ maybe set up an email group to keep everyone informed of meetings

### Making work happen: 
- Hard to get enough quality user research in  

### Process 
- Should have filled in more sprint team members at the end 
- Do more backend prototyping
